        <p>My name is Dontae Whitely, born on April 26, 2003.<br> 
            I am a proud alumnus of Calabar High School and currently a third-year student at the University of the West Indies, Mona, where I am pursuing a BSc in Electronics and Computer Science. 
            <br>My passion for technology drives me, and my ultimate goal is to become a computer engineer and eventually own an engineering firm.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Beyond my academic and professional aspirations, I am deeply interested in philanthropy. 
            I aim to help the boys and girls of Jamaica achieve their goals through social and academic support. 
            Additionally, I am a history buff with a particular interest in World War II facts and an avid supporter of 
            Manchester City Football Club. I am a proud patriot of my country, Jamaica, and I will make it my life's duty to contribute to its development.

        <h2>AI is the Future of Mental Health Therapy! But!</h2>
        <p class="dateauthor">October 7, 2024 by Dontae Whitely</p>
        <img src="ai.jpeg" alt="Image of ai" class="image-left">

        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are revolutionizing mental health treatment through conversational interfaces. These systems, often driven by large language models, aim to bridge the gap between expert advice and accessibility. However, these AIs raise ethical concerns, 
            including bias, unequal treatment of marginalized communities, and data privacy and confidentiality issues.</p>
  
        <p>Therapists believe that people’s rights and dignity must be respected and their privacy, confidentiality, and self-determination must be preserved. 
            Psychologists value each person's inherent worth and dignity as well as their freedom to privacy, confidentiality, and self-determination. Since AI systems in mental healthcare deal with extremely private and secret data, they may be vulnerable to data leaks that might reveal private patient information. According to Jeremiah Fowler (2024), Confidant Health, an AI-driven mental health service, 
            suffered a significant data breach where personal information, including therapy notes and medical records, was leaked.</p>
